# urine-test-repo
This repo documents the process, code, and result for a synthetic urine test data.<br>
### Part1_Task1
This part begins to look at the data and performs several visualization tasks:<br>
- The percentage of samples resistant and sensitive to each antibiotic.
- The presence of each resistance gene across the samples.
- The distribution of cell counts for each organism.
### Part1_Task2
This part provides a function to add new data to the existing dataframe and a corresponding unit test for that function.
### Part2_Task1
This part builds a Bayesian logistic regression model to estimate the relationship between organisms counts and antibiotics response.
### Part2_Task2
This part performs PCA on the organism count variables and visualizes the data on the reduced principal component dimensions.
